# DounialsSpicetifyTheme
My custom configured Spicetify Theme (Based on the original Matte theme)

<h3>How do I apply/choose your Theme?</h3>
1.) It's simple, just download Spicetify (link here: https://github.com/spicetify/spicetify-cli/releases/tag/v2.24.2). <br>
2.) Run the setup and then choose the Matte-color-theme with "Spicefify config current_theme Matte". <br>
3.) Go to your local .config Spicetify-folder and change the current color.ini with the one I uploaded here. <br>
4.) Save the file. <br>
5.) Run "spicetify apply" <br>
6.) Voila - your new theme is applied to your system! :) <br>
